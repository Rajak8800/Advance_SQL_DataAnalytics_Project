- Aggregations (`SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`)
- Window Functions (`RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Subqueries and Joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`)
- Case Statements and Conditional Logic
- Indexing and Performance Optimization

SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
```sql
-- Monthly sales trend
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identified high-value customers contributing significantly to revenue.
- **Sales Trends**: Sales peak during festive seasons, requiring stock management adjustments.
- **Performance Analysis**: Certain products show consistent underperformance, suggesting a review.
